      <p> It was July. July, 22 of the year 2019- to be exact. I got a call from my close friend, Peppa the Pig. Peppa seemed sad, I was quick to ask if my friend was doing alright. But Peppa was distracted and asked me if I knew how to whistle. Weird question- I've never even heard of whistling before this. But after Peppa explained it, I understood what she was talking about. As I attempted to whistle for the very first time, I was not aware of what was happening with Peppa. As a whistled a tune, I heard the dial tone. Peppa was never happy for me. Just like that time when we were playing Snap, and I won, and Peppa accussed me of cheating. Peppa was supposed to be my girl- but she's just my number one hater. </p>
